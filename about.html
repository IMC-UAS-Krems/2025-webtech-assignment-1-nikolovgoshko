                    <p>
                        I'm studying Informatics at the University of IMC Krems. I was always intrigued by how computers work and that's what started my journey.

            <article>
                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>
                    I started training in football at the age of 5 and reached a semi-professional level by 16. I eventually decided to stop, as I didn’t see a clear and stable future in pursuing it further.
                </p>

                <h3>Computers</h3>
                <p>
                    I was always intrigued by how computers work, which sparked my journey into technology. After discovering this passion, I attended a programming-focused high school that helped me further develop my skills.
                </p>

                <h3>Going out</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy going out, socializing, and exploring new environments, as it helps me stay balanced and open to new experiences.

            <article>
                <p>
I was born in the city of Ruse, Bulgaria, on the 23rd of November, 2006. It’s the sixth-largest city in the country. I graduated from a programming-focused high school and decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Informatics at IMC.                </p>
